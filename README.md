## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anilkumarbanti/ES6-Demo.git


### Navigate to the project directory:
- cd es6-demo
Open the project in your code editor to explore the examples.

### Usage
- Each concept is demonstrated in a separate JavaScript file within the project directory. You can run these files using Node.js to see the output and understand how each ES6 feature works. For example, to run the file demonstrating let and const, use the following command:
  - node let-and-const.js
